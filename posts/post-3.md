TypeScript is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. Itâ€™s become a popular choice among developers for adding type safety and improving code quality.

### Why TypeScript?
With TypeScript, you can catch errors early through static analysis and provide robust code completion for better developer experience.

#### Example:
```typescript
function greet(name: string): string {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
